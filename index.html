		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p> Kobe Bean Bryant  was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the <br>National Basketball Association (NBA). Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Bryant helped the Lakers win five NBA championships, and was an <br>18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time<br> NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.<br>
			When Did Kobe Die: January 26, 2020<br>
			In an absolutely tragic helicopter accident, making things a bit worse was the fact that all nine passengers on the flight,<br> including Kobe’s 13-year-old daughter Gianna, perished in the tragic accident. They were gone far too soon.
